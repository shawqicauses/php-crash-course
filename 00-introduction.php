/*
- Introduction To PHP
- PHP is a general-purpose scripting language geared toward web development
- PHP is an interpreted server-side language, which means a web server usually processes the PHP code
- We write PHP code inside its opening and closing tags like what we do with HTML tags
- We can write PHP code alongside HTML code in the same file
- We often use PHP with a relational database like MySQL

- For PHP to work, you can not simply load the PHP file to the browser and have it work as we do with
  HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. That is because PHP is not a client-side language, it is a server-side language,
  so you need to install PHP itself on your local machine along with a web server.
  
- When you open a URL that ends with a .php file extension in the browser, it makes an HTTP request
  to a server that runs PHP. Then, the server processes the code you have written within the PHP tags and
  sends back the processed HTML code or whatever data type you want.

- To develop PHP on your local machine, you must install a collection of development software so your system can interpret
  and run PHP code. One of these development software is PHP itself, Apache web server, and MySQL database, which you can install
  separately on your system, but software suites like XAMPP include everything you need to start developing PHP.
